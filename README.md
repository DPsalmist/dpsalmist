### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack software developer who develops websites and web apps. I am a machine learning enthusiast and a tech facilitator. 
I also love sharing my knowledge via teaching/training.

My current stacks are: 
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Bulma CSS & Material UI 
- Python (Django & Flask)
- Javascript (Node & Express js)
- Databases such as MySql, SQLite, Postgres & Mongo DB.
- ðŸŒ± My future learning plan is Vue js and a mobile app framework to improve my frontend skills.
- I'm brushing up my data science/machine skills currently.



 ## Iâ€™m open to collaboration on challenging projects and also open to remote jobs.
